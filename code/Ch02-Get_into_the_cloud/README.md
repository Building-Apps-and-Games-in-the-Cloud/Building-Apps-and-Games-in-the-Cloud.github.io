Make a numbered list by starting each line with a number followed by a period (full stop):

Put code into blocks by using ```
```Javascript
function doAddition(p1, p2) {

    alert("Result:" + result);
}
```
Links are easy too https://www.robmiles.com or with names [my blog](http://www.robmiles.com)
